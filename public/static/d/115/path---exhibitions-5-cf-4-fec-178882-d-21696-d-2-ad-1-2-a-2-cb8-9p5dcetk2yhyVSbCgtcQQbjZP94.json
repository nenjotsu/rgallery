But a civilization that counters the flow of our mother nature has negative effects. We ahave let people to have an unending desire to build and build more gigantic machines and huge buildings, sacrificing the resources from our mother nature in exchange of a large amount of profit that goes only to the hands of the few and harnessing the future of our children and of the next generation.\n\nThe widespread urban progress has let our society to act and to think like programmed machines and not as free individuals doing all things in exchange for a paper bill to avoid poverty and satisfy our unending needs. This has let our society to behave differently, cutting all our connection to nature and forgetting our true identity as human beings rooted to our mother nature . We have lost ourselves following all the propaganda and certain ideology that keep people into divided groups prioritizing war and abomination \nrather than those things which concerned our global climate status. But some of us never realized the real cost of all these, that we will soon eat this trash in the final act.\n\nIt is about time for all of us to be much more aware to think on how we can face the future of humanity when we totally drained the resources of our planet. Leading our way to extinction which is not far from happening if we keep tolerating the deterioration of nature.","date_from":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","date_to":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":null,"artworks":[],"artists":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Exhibitions_5cf4fec178882d21696d2ad1"}}
