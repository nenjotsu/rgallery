Take as example a person’s smile, a swaying tree, teary eyes, a darkened sky and even the more universal ones such as the cross, a gun, or a white flag. In many moments and in different places, there are many images around us that represent a meaning and are able to speak to us in various ways, perhaps in an indirect but relevant and subconscious manner. This is the focal point of R Gallery’s latest art exhibit that opens on February 28.\n\nAptly titled Semiotics, the art exhibit is inspired by the impressive science of symbols in art. The show will exhibit the works of Abe Orobia who also curated the show, Alvin Paraguison, Edmund Andrada, Janos Delacruz, Jet Rai, Judeo Herrera, and Nhel Ricahuerta. While these artists have a commonality in their artistry in a sense that they approach most of their works in a figurative sense, guests and enthusiasts alike can expect dynamism and diversity in the pieces from these Filipino artists.\n\nIt can be said that an artist’s genius lies on his own symbol by creating a meaning out of his work from the vast universal symbols available in the world and in the world of art. From a universal standpoint, the inspiration and style of an artist as he creates his work become contextual and much more personal. Each of the seven featured contemporary artists are expected to feature subjects that range from a personal, historical, nostalgia, current issues, among others. The show becomes a highly curated show that consciously provide freedom to the artists’ creativity and personal artistic sense.\n\nAcknowledging the symbols around us that become personal artistic inspirations, Semiotics as a show intend to highlight how everything in a visual art, all elements in each piece is a symbol that tells a story even without words and serve as a guide that lead you to an experience and conclusion. It makes one further appreciate how an art piece is an honest creation made by its creator for it to be shared with, read, and understood by others, until we all experience the deeper meanings of the symbols revolving around it, around us, and within us.","date_from":"2019-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","date_to":"2019-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":300,"height":400,"src":"/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/eadbd/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/eadbd/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 1x,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/f7c4a/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/6d7df/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 2x"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.75,"src":"/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/f709c/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/7417d/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 113w,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/49de1/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 225w,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/f709c/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 450w,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/3d22d/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 675w,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/2b1a3/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 900w,\n/static/5966be2cf04737d8a50e1d72f49db358/b4a0b/f7e11ee5c03563009af25650cccb7822.jpg 2700w","sizes":"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"}}},"artworks":[],"artists":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Exhibitions_5cf5029e78882d21696d2ad3"}}
