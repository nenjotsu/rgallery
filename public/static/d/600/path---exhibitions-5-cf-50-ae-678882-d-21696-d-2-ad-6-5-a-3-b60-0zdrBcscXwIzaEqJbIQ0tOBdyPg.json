{"data":{"strapiExhibitions":{"title":"VISITING LUNA","descriptions":"With a name that draws one to its light, like a werewolf, Luna has captivated the hearts of Filipinos both in the history of the past and the generation of the present with the life he had lived that was full of nationalism, patriotism, and artistry. Not only was he an important icon in the development of the Philippine nation, Luna’s creative gift and talent also paved way to international prominence for the Filipino art. His affiliations with the world’s royalties, famous artists, and political figures were only some fragments of his character that display how decorated of a man was he.\n\nLuna’s style falls largely on romanticism as evident from the characters he portrayed, sceneries and narratives of his subjects, employing the literary aspect of romantic thinkers by dealing with liberalism, radical thoughts, nationalism and conservatism. Had it not been for his untimely demise, Philippines and the world would have seen more of his artistic pursuits and yet, in the life he had been given, he left so much of his art for all Filipinos.\n\nAs a way of tribute and to open an artistic portal to Luna’s legacy, R Gallery brings these Filipino artists who made creations as a contemporary update to the mind, style, and passion of such a legendary Filipino artist.
