From these moments, we create memories that remind us of the things that made us happy and made us sad. It teaches us how beginnings and endings are both inevitable aspects of human living. And even when these experiences have passed, we are able to connect to the things that matter, because of the love that we have carried in these passing moments. The love that has the power to give value to the things we wish we hold on to.\n\nIn the next art exhibit of R Gallery, it provides an avenue for gathering not just of Filipino contemporary artists whose works are to be showcased but to guests alike. It will be an opportunity for loved ones to gather together, friends to reunite, and for guests to simply appreciate the importance of human bond and how our care for each other links our different lives as one.\n\nWe grow with our loved ones, lose old friends and make new ones, get hurt and be joyful, find courage in new beginnings. No matter what it is. One thing is for sure, we all have a Conclave Ground, sooner and not later, we will reunite with hope in our final gathering.","date_from":"2019-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","date_to":"2019-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":null,"artworks":[],"artists":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Exhibitions_5cf5023878882d21696d2ad2"}}
