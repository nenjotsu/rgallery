{"data":{"strapiExhibitions":{"title":"REASONS","descriptions":"It is innate for humans to question everything. History could attest that people have tried several times to search for answers, even for those considered to be unexplainable. Some quests were successful to find answers, but some remain to be fulfilled. As the most intellectual and emotional creatures here on earth, human beings always have reasons or will always try to have one for every single phenomenon, no matter how small or big.\n\nIn this group exhibition, R Gallery presents seven young and upcoming artists share their reasons – for art, for love, for hate, for living, for knowing and not knowing, for life and for every existence they know. Let their artworks speak what is commonly left unspoken and explain what is usually hidden and left unanswered. Allow their masterpieces speak to your minds and emotions, and tickle your imaginations, and maybe it will help you uncover your own reasons.","date_from":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","date_to":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":null,"artworks":[],"artists":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Exhibitions_5cf4fe9478882d21696d2ad0"}}
